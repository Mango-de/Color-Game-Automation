Those programs automate the color game of [realtimecolors.com](https://www.realtimecolors.com/game) by automatically clicking the right square.

PyAutoGUI requires an open Browser window and that the coordinates of a point of all the squares are set.

Selenium automatically opens the Firefox Browser.
